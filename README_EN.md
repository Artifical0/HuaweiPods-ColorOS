HuaweiPods ColorOS is an Android 15+ Xposed module with the independent application ID `io.github.artifical0.huaweipods.coloros`, so the original HuaweiPods LSPosed marketplace entry cannot replace it. ColorOS integration includes the official Quick Device Connect popup, the My Devices headset-detail entry, the system earphone battery channel, and an Android 16+ Live Alert / Fluid Cloud battery card.

> Starting with 1.9.0.1 this fork targets ColorOS only. The upstream Xiaomi / HyperOS integrations (system Bluetooth detail page, Super Island, Fusion Device Center, and so on) have been removed; HyperOS users should use upstream [HuaweiPods](https://github.com/Nshpiter/HuaweiPods).

> The My Devices entry supports both the ColorOS 16.1 (`com.heytap.mydevices` 17.4.15) and ColorOS 17 (17.25.10) detail pages. The ColorOS 17 work was checked statically against OnePlus PLK110 `PLK110_17.0.0.102(CN01)` firmware and still needs on-device verification. Private hosts change between system updates; unknown builds fall back to the stock pages while keeping the module UI, Live Alerts, and the standard Bluetooth detail page.

The unified build supports the 19 models below in one APK. Model-specific test APKs are no longer distributed; newly added models still need ColorOS device testing.

## 1.9.1.1 (current stable release)

- Adds FreeBuds 6 model recognition, official image identity, captured ANC levels and a dedicated controls page; keeps FreeBuds 6 distinct from 6i.
- Adds FreeClip 2 Collector Edition product identity `000173`, separate from ordinary `000167` images. FreeClip 2 gains confirmed nod/shake call actions and noisy-environment volume-boost readback, replacing the incorrect quality-priority label. Bundled family illustrations remain the fallback until official images are available.
- Routes generic low-latency writes and 6i / SE 4 ANC EQ/wind controls through the Bluetooth host. Manual changes invalidate older auto-enable writes and callbacks; outstanding requests are bounded and expire after eight seconds.
- Preserves ColorOS lifecycle, image isolation and sender checks. No HyperOS private UI or unverified SE 4 ANC adaptive-ANC command is imported. New models and cross-process paths still require real-device testing; no device was installed or restarted in this step.
- Local verification: 577 unit tests passed, Lint had no errors, and Release assembly plus Android-test compilation succeeded. VersionCode 27 uses the existing fixed distribution certificate, not the local Debug certificate. This is published to the stable channel on GitHub and the independent LSPosed module repository; new models still need ColorOS device testing. See the [release notes and limitations](.github/release-notes/1.9.1.1.md).

## 1.9.0.1

> Versions now follow `<upstream version>.<fork revision>`; the ColorOS label lives in the app name, and APKs are named `HuaweiPods-ColorOS-<version>-release.apk`.

- Syncs upstream HuaweiPods 1.9.0: adds HUAWEI FreeBuds 7.
- **More responsive My Devices battery**: while earbuds are connected, battery is refreshed in the background every 15 seconds and immediately when the screen turns on.
- **Quick controls in My Devices**: the HuaweiPods entry gains an Off / Noise cancelling / Awareness switch or a low-latency toggle, depending on the model, synced with the earbuds.
- **System Bluetooth settings**: the device list shows left/right battery and the detail page gets an earphone-settings entry that opens HuaweiPods (requires the optional `com.oplus.wirelesssettings` scope).
- **Low battery reminder** when an earbud that is not charging drops to 20% and again at 10%; can be turned off or previewed in settings.
- **Wear state**: the earbuds' in-ear report is forwarded to the system.
- **ColorOS only**: removes the Xiaomi / HyperOS hooks, scopes, settings, and dependencies (Super Island, focus notifications, Fusion Device Center, Xiaomi Bluetooth, the Settings detail page). LSPosed scopes are now Bluetooth, My Devices, Quick Device Connect, and optionally Huawei AI Life audio.
- The About page now shows this fork's maintainer and lists the upstream project separately.

## ColorOS 17 adaptation and native integration (1.8.3-coloros.1)

- Syncs upstream HuaweiPods 1.8.3: HUAWEI FreeBuds SE 4 ANC support, saving successful low-latency writes from the module popup, and the 1.7.x–1.8.x protocol, UI, and stability updates.
- **System earphone battery**: the Bluetooth process publishes left, right, and case battery levels to ColorOS's own earphone battery channel (the one AirPods and partner earbuds use) and to the standard Android battery level, so the status bar, Bluetooth settings, and My Devices can read them.
- **Quick Device Connect popup** now covers every supported model instead of FreeClip only, with the model's bundled image when no cached official image exists.
- **My Devices (ColorOS 17)**: supports the new preference-based detail page; its Bluetooth settings entry shows HuaweiPods battery and settings and opens the module popup.
- **Quick Device Connect (ColorOS 17)**: follows the renamed card data class and close method in 17.6.x so the card is not dismissed immediately.
- Bluetooth-process hooks, Live Alerts, and system settings intents were checked against ColorOS 17 firmware and remain compatible.
- **LSPosed API 102**: the release build now uses the upstream API 102 entry. On API 102 frameworks such as Vector, installing an update hot-reloads the hooks without restarting each scope; frameworks that only provide API 101 still load the module, just without hot reload.

## ColorOS startup and Live Alerts

Enable HuaweiPods ColorOS in the system auto-launch settings. Under App info → Battery management, allow all background activity (this may increase battery usage). Grant Bluetooth and notification permissions, enable Live Alerts, and open the app once after installation. Recheck these settings after reinstalling.

After updating, restart the Bluetooth scope or reboot the phone to load the new module; the headset will briefly disconnect.

ColorOS 16 was verified on 2026-09-08 (1.8.1-coloros.3) with OnePlus PLK110, `PLK110_16.0.10.500(CN01)`, Android 16 (API 36), and HUAWEI FreeClip: module-service status and Live Alerts work; after terminating the app process and restarting Bluetooth, reconnecting the headset restores the Live Alert without opening the app. Recovery after a full phone reboot has not been tested.

Versions from 1.8.1-coloros.2 use a stable release key and support in-place updates. Earlier builds signed with the old key require reinstalling, which clears local app data; save your settings first.

- **Post-update scope restart prompt** after installing a newer APK.
- **Official model images** downloaded from Huawei's CDN after modern devices report an exact model and color identity over Bluetooth; manual and built-in images remain available as fallbacks.

## Requirements

- OPPO / OnePlus / realme device running ColorOS 16 / 17.
- Android 15+.
- LSPosed API version >= 101 (API 102 frameworks additionally hot-reload updates).
- A paired device listed in the support table above.

## Usage

1. Install the HuaweiPods APK and follow the first-run guide to check LSPosed and the core scopes.
2. Enable the module in LSPosed.
3. Select the scopes for your system:
   - Required: `com.android.bluetooth`, `com.heytap.mydevices`, and `com.heytap.accessory` (`com.heytap.accessory` enables the system Quick Device Connect popup).
   - Optional: `com.oplus.wirelesssettings` (earphone battery and settings entry in the system Bluetooth settings).
   - Optional: `com.huawei.smartaudio` (when Huawei AI Life/Smart Audio is installed, for FreeClip 2 spatial-audio and custom-EQ synchronization).
4. Reboot the phone, or restart the scoped apps from HuaweiPods.
5. On ColorOS 16+, open **ColorOS Fluid Cloud** in HuaweiPods settings and enable **Live alerts** in the system notification settings.
6. Connect a supported device and view its capabilities in HuaweiPods. Battery also appears in My Devices and Fluid Cloud. Modern models are identified from their protocol identity; if a renamed or legacy device is not identified, select its actual model once in HuaweiPods.

The release build no longer needs to install, run, or hook HUAWEI AI Life Audio for official images. Modern models provide the model and color identity over Bluetooth; legacy models can browse the verified Huawei color catalog in the image settings and ask the user to confirm once. Failures always fall back to cached or bundled images and never guess the default color.

Toggle low latency from the module popup or detail page. Version 1.8.3 fixes a popup issue where a successful FreeBuds 6i low-latency write was not saved and the switch appeared off when reopened. Because the protocol has no reliable readback for this setting, the UI shows the last successful write that will be reapplied after reconnection rather than a live device-reported state. The effect on the earbuds still needs device testing.

## Development Notes

Internal package names, broadcast actions, configuration names, and the public app identity are unified as HuaweiPods.
